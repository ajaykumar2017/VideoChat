# VideoChat
Today, the video chat landscape is much simpler thanks to WebRTC: an open source project built and maintained by Google, Mozilla, Opera and others. WebRTC allows you to easily build real-time communication software in your browser and is being standardized at the W3C &amp; IETF levels. Using WebRTC, you can build real-time video chat applications in the browser that actually work well! It's pretty amazing.  Today, I thought it'd be fun to walk you through the process of using WebRTC and Okta to build a simple video chat service that allows users to create a chatroom and share the link around to anyone they want who can then join the room and chat with them in real-time.
